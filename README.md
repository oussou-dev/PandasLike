# **PandasLike**

~~~
Build a fully-functioning Python library similar to Pandas with TDD (PyTest)
~~~


## **Description**

Build PandasLike, a library that implements many of the most common and useful methods found in pandas

## **Goals**

- [ ] Build a fully-functioning Python library similar to pandas for data analysis
- [ ] Built a fully-functioning Python library that is able to complete many common data analysis tasks
- [ ] Advanced Python topics such as special methods and property decorators
- [ ] Using the Python data model to allow objects to work seamlessly with builtin Python functions and operators
- [ ] Build a DataFrame class with the following functionality:
    - [ ] Have a DataFrame class with data stored in numpy arrays
    - [ ] Select subsets of data with the brackets operator
    - [ ] Aggregation methods - sum, min, max, mean, median, etc...
    - [ ] Non-aggregation methods such as isna, unique, rename, drop
    - [ ] Group by one or two columns to create pivot tables
    - [ ] Specific methods for handling string columns
    - [ ] Read in data from a comma-separated value file
    - [ ] A nicely formatted display of the DataFrame in the notebook
- [ ] Complete a large, comprehensive project
    - [ ] Creating a development environment
    - [ ] Test-driven development with pytest
    - [ ] Using test-driven development to ensure code quality



## **Concepts covered in the project**


- [] Structure for building a library from scratch
- [] Creating and using development environments
- [] Test-Driven development




## **Stack used in the project**

- [] conda
- [] jupyter
- [] VS Code
- [] ipython kernels
- [] git
- [] pytest
- [] numpy



## **Takeaways from the project**

- Understand structure of building a library
- Handling and raising errors
- Creating and using private methods
- Use python decorators
- OOP in Python
- Use the isinstance function
- Use the getattr function
- Use _repr_html_ ipython method to produce a represenation of objects in jupyter
- Use _ipython_key_completions_ ipython method
- Use zip, enumerate, iter, next
- Understand and use *args and **kwargs*
- Create a group of methods with the an accessor like pandas str, dt, and cat
- Automatically add documentation
- Use a defaultdict

### **Numpy**

- ndim
- repeat
- unique
- roll
- isnan
- argsort
- lexsort
- random.choice
- array.dtype.kind
- unicode type array
- Reverse a list or np array 
    > a[::-1]
        
    


### **Python**

- Some of the Magic functions used in the project
    - __len__
    - __doc__
    - __add__
    - __radd__
    - __truediv__
    - __floordiv__
    - __pow__
    - __gt__
    - __lt__
    - __ge__
    - __ne__
    - __eq__
    - __getitem__
    - __setitem__
    - @property
    - @property.setter


        ```
        @property
            def columns(self):

        @columns.setter
            def columns(self, columns):
        ```
